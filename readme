What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

Lecture slides from lecture 4. Slide 25 inspired the logic of my DFA
Precept handout from Precept 3. circle2.c helped me write to stderr
Assignment page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I thought this was very helpful. I had not encountered DFAs before since
I am a transfer student and my previous courses did not cover it. It was
a cool way to decomment the program.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I do not have any known bugs in my program. I had an issue with adding
newlines in comments but eventually I figured it out.
